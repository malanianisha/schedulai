## ✨ What it does
- **Transcript analyzer** highlights degree progress and unmet requirements  
- **Graduation predictor** estimates timeline based on completed/remaining units  
- **Course offerings tracker** surfaces times/locations/availability  
- **Schedule sync** finds overlapping free time for group work and mentoring
